# learning-toy

## Introduction

The concept of education through learning toys has historical roots dating back to the 17th century. Among these educational toys, the Tower of Hanoi stands out not only as a reference in this culture but also as a tool used by the scientific community in the fields of Neurology and Psychology to identify certain pathologies. Given its versatility, the Tower of Hanoi can be employed in diverse contexts: from aiding in the diagnosis of mental disorders to serving as a key learning element in alternative educational settings. It is also a toy that appeals to all age groups.

The project aims to enhance the interaction between the user, especially children, and the toy through the integration of electronics. This endeavor is driven by personal motivations, including the author's experiences with family members who have mental disorders. The aspiration to contribute to the development of solutions in this area, coupled with the entrepreneurial spirit nurtured by affiliations like the Incubadora do CEFET/RJ (IETEC), has been a significant driving force behind the project. Furthermore, a deep-rooted desire to revolutionize the world of education has always been at the heart of the project's motivations.

## Development of the Idea:

The central concept of the project revolves around the integration of electronics into a traditional learning toy, aiming to foster a more interactive relationship between the user and the toy. In this context, the toy in focus is the Tower of Hanoi, a well-established educational tool. The project's vision is to enable the toy to communicate with external devices, facilitating data exchange through various protocols such as WIFI and Bluetooth. This enhanced interaction is envisioned to be particularly beneficial for children, offering them a more engaging and educational experience.

## Methodology and Work Done:

The execution of this project necessitated a comprehensive case study exploring the myriad possibilities of integrating electronics into the toy. This research paved the way for the project's direction. Subsequent to this foundational research, in-depth studies were conducted to gain a better understanding of the electronic components and their potential applications. Following this, experiments were carried out to validate the chosen methodology. Once validated, these experimental findings were applied to a prototype. After rigorous testing on the prototype, further refinements and developments were made.

## Entrepreneurial Aspects:

Parallel to the technological development, there was a secondary objective focused on the entrepreneurial aspect. This involved understanding how to implement the developed technology in the market. The author's interactions and experiences at the Incubadora do CEFET/RJ (IETEC) and exposure to the entrepreneurial world played a pivotal role in shaping this aspect of the project. The ambition was not just to create a technologically advanced toy but also to understand its market potential and the nuances of introducing such a product to potential consumers.
